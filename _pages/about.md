I’m a PhD student in the School of Social Policy & Practice at the University of Pennsylvania. My research focuses on how mental health systems can better promote recovery and equity—especially through recovery-oriented practice, peer support, and culturally responsive services. Methodologically, I use quantitative methods and text-as-data / NLP approaches to produce transparent, policy-relevant evidence.

**Current areas of work**
- **Peer support workforce & role construction:** large-scale analysis of U.S. peer support worker job postings (text-as-data dissertation)
- **Implementation & systems design:** integrating peer support specialists in crisis and emergency response systems
- **Help-seeking & stigma:** service access, stigma, and disparities among student and immigrant populations
